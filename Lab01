⚙️ Final Project

This section will contain details about our final AI-enhanced cybersecurity project.
Additional information, diagrams, datasets, and implementation notes will be added later in the semester.

🔬 Laboratory Work

Throughout the course, we completed a series of hands-on labs designed to show how AI, data pipelines, and modern security workflows are used in real environments.
The exercises involve working with:

Real CTI reports

Security event logs

Network flow data

NLP-based threat examples

AI/ML-driven detection techniques

These labs gradually develop practical skills relevant for SOC operations, CTI analysis, and AI-powered cybersecurity systems.
