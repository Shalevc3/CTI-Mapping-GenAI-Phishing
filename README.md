## 🔬 Laboratory Work

During the semester, we worked on several hands-on labs demonstrating how AI-driven techniques, modern data pipelines, and cybersecurity methodologies are used in real-world environments.
<!--
The labs include practical work with:

- Real CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) reports  
- Network and security logs  
- ML/NLP-based threat detection examples  
- Data processing workflows and accelerated pipelines  

These exercises build knowledge and skills applicable to SOC, CTI, and AI-enhanced cybersecurity roles.
