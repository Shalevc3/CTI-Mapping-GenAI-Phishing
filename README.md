# Misuse of GenAI Platforms for Phishing – CTI Mapping Report

This repository includes our submission for **Lab Work 1 – Cyber Threat Intelligence**.  
The assignment is based on the Unit 42 article *“Fashionable Phishing Bait: GenAI on the Hook” (2025)* and focuses on how Generative AI (GenAI) tools are being misused to create phishing content quickly and at scale.


## 🚀 What’s Inside

- **CTI_Report.docx** – The full written report, including:
  - Short description of the activity
  - Attack flow diagram
  - Detailed MITRE ATT&CK mapping
  - Key takeaways and conclusions

- **Attack_Schema.drawio** – Visual diagram outlining the attack chain.

- **README.md** – This file, summarizing the purpose and structure of the project.


## 🔍 Project Overview

The Unit 42 report describes how attackers are increasingly relying on GenAI services—such as AI website builders and writing assistants—to generate phishing pages with very little effort.  
These platforms allow anyone to create a convincing website in seconds, publish it without verification and use it to redirect victims to credential-harvesting pages.

Our work maps these behaviors to relevant **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**, showing how each part of the process fits into a broader threat model.


## 🧩 MITRE ATT&CK Tactics Covered

- Initial Access  
- Resource Development  
- Execution  
- Defense Evasion  
- Credential Access  
- Command and Control  
- Impact

The full table with all technique IDs is included in the Word report.
